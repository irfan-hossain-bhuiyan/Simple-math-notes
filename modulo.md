>a(mod x)={a+nx: x in N}=a+0(mod x)

>(a+b)(mod x)=a(mod x)+b(mod x)

>a(mod 1)=N

>a(mod x)=a(mod x1) I a(mod x2) I a(mod x3) .... where x=x1*x2*x3


Let's suppose the only thing function takes is a set.
So it don't takes number.when I say f(1) it actually means f({1}).
>Here f(A)={f(x):x in A}
The speciality of set with other math abstruction is that it only knows what is in it. It doesn't know 
where is it in the set, how many of one thing is there. It just knows if its there or not.
So,if some problem need to care only the values,set is really powerful.

If it need some position use some vector.set doesn,t have position ,
So it can't have duplicate(**why is that I don't know.I just feel like it.**)

If I treat a set as number I can explain 
>a+x=a   where a=b(mod x)
>example: {....-2,0,2,4,6,8....}+2={...-2,0,2,4,6,8.....}
In simple number system a should be infinity.


Now there are some properties of intersection and union.
1.f(A U B)=f(A) U f(B) where f is any function.
2.f(A I B)=f(A) I f(B) where f in one_to_one function.
3.f(A/B)=f(A)/f(B)     where f in one_to_one function.


**f(x)=x+a is a one_to_one function.**
**that means (0(mod x1) I 0(mod x2) I ....) +a=a(mod x1) I a(mod x2)....**
## proof
	if f(A)=A and f(B)=B than f(A U B)=f(A U B) , f(A I B)=f(A) I f(B) 
	beacuse f(x)=x is one_to_one function.
# Hypotheses:

Every properties like prime number and factor etc can be explained by set and symmetry
