f([a,b])=[x,y,z]
if there a solution for every real x,y,z.It mostly doesn't because you can't make two variable to three variable.
But for f([a,b,c]) it doesn't still confirm that there would be output for every [x,y,z].Lie what are the condition a function must obey so that f([a,b,c])=[x,y,z]



Here is the question,There are three object in 3d dimension in different position. They don't have to be same density eveverywhere.Proof that there is a plane intersect the three of the object and split them in equal mass.

The fuction I know that have this property


## My Thought:
I can turn this into function f(a,b)
