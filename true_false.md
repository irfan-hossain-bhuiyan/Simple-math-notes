# Trying to answer the question what exactly true and false means.

>true and false are two sets of statement that are **cosets**.
>So if one statement can't be in both true and false at the same time.One of the main principle of math.

But what it means not to be true and false at the same time.Does all statement fall to T(true set) or F(False set).
Isn't there any middle ground.

I can relate True and False statement set with set of numbers.
like negative number set are false and positive number set are true
>I can turn any positive to neagtive with adding minus to it.

>I can turn any true statement to false by adding "not" to it.

So shouldn't there be something like 0 for statement set.The value doesn't change if I add not to it.

Like -0  is still 0.There are 2 things we could do for 0
1.We could add 0 to both negative and positive number set.
2.Make a new set with 0

There are some statement they are like 0 for numbers.They are true and false at the same time.
Ex:
1.This statement is not true.
2.This statement is true.

"This statement is true" can be both true and false.If I add not to it then "This statement is false" is also both true and false.Unlike the statement 1 where just true or false satisfy the statement hte second one have to be both true and false at the same time.

###Now is there any way to connect it with halting problem:
